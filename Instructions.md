# Lexitra Project Creation and File Processing Issues Analysis

## 1. Current Issues

### 1.1 Database Schema Issues
- Error in logs indicates missing "status" column in files table
- Schema mismatch causing SQL errors: `column "status" of relation "files" does not exist`

### 1.2 File Processing Issues
- Project creation page remains in "Creating" state during file processing
- No progress indication for large file uploads
- PDF processing delays block project creation UI feedback

## 2. Affected Components

### 2.1 Frontend Components
- `client/src/pages/projects.tsx`: Project creation form and file upload handling
- `client/src/components/file-progress-indicator.tsx`: Progress indicator component

### 2.2 Backend Components
- `server/routes.ts`: File processing and project creation logic
- `shared/schema.ts`: Database schema definitions
- `db/migrations/`: Database migration files

## 3. Root Causes

1. Database Schema Mismatch:
- The code attempts to access a `status` column that doesn't exist in the files table
- This suggests a missing database migration or incomplete schema update

2. Synchronous File Processing:
- Large file processing blocks project creation
- No separate workflow for file processing and project creation
- Lack of progress feedback to frontend

## 4. Solution Plan

### 4.1 Database Schema Updates
1. Add `status` column to files table
2. Add `processing_status` column to track file processing state
3. Create migration to update existing records

### 4.2 File Processing Improvements
1. Implement asynchronous file processing:
   - Create project record immediately
   - Process files in background
   - Update file status as processing completes

2. Add WebSocket notifications for:
   - File upload progress
   - Processing status updates
   - Project creation completion

### 4.3 UI Enhancements
1. Add progress indicators for:
   - File upload
   - File processing
   - Project creation

2. Display file status in project list:
   - Pending
   - Processing
   - Ready
   - Error

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. Database Updates:
```sql
ALTER TABLE files
ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
ADD COLUMN processing_status TEXT DEFAULT 'waiting';
```

2. Backend Changes:
- Modify file upload handlers for async processing
- Add WebSocket notifications for progress updates
- Implement file status tracking

3. Frontend Updates:
- Add progress indicators
- Implement WebSocket listeners
- Update UI to show file/project status

4. Testing:
- Verify file upload with large files
- Test project creation workflow
- Validate progress indicators
- Check database schema changes

## 6. Success Criteria

1. Project creation completes quickly, independent of file processing
2. Users see clear progress indicators for:
   - File upload
   - File processing
   - Project creation
3. File processing status is accurately reflected in UI
4. Large files don't block or timeout the UI

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

1. Risk: Database migration affecting existing projects
   Mitigation: Add default values and handle null cases

2. Risk: File processing failures
   Mitigation: Add robust error handling and status updates

3. Risk: WebSocket connection issues
   Mitigation: Implement fallback polling mechanism
