# Lexitra Auth Debug Follow-Up: Cookie Not Sent (Despite CORS Fix)

## ❗ Problem: Cookie Still Not Sent

After restarting the server, the login succeeds, but authenticated session is not preserved. All API requests still fail with `401 Unauthorized` and `req.headers.cookie` is `undefined`.

---

## 🔍 Observed Console Logs

```
cookies: undefined
user: undefined
```

→ This confirms that cookies are **not being sent** to the server in follow-up requests.
→ Session data cannot be retrieved; all authentication checks fail.

## ✅ Likely Cause: Incorrect CORS Origin

Replit reported:

> ✓ CORS origin set to true

This is **not sufficient** for cookie-based auth.

### ⚠️ Why `origin: true` doesn’t work

* When `origin: true` is set, Express reflects the request origin dynamically.
* But for `credentials: true` to work, browsers **require a fixed string** for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
* If CORS sends `*` (wildcard), **cookies will never be sent.**

---

## ✅ Correct Configuration (Required)

```ts
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:5173',  // MUST be exact string, not true or *
  credentials: true
}));
```

> Replace with your actual frontend domain if needed (e.g. `https://lexitra.replit.app`)

## 🧪 How to Verify

1. **DevTools → Network → login request → Response Headers**

   * ✅ Look for `Set-Cookie:`
   * ✅ Confirm `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` matches frontend URL
   * ✅ Confirm `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`

2. **DevTools → Application → Cookies**

   * ✅ Check if session cookie is saved

3. **Check follow-up requests**

   * ✅ Do they contain `Cookie:` header?
   * ✅ Is `req.session.user` defined on server?

---

## 🔧 Summary

Even if Replit believes CORS is configured, **if origin is set to `true` or `*`, cookie auth will fail.**

To resolve:

* Use fixed `origin: 'http://localhost:5173'` (or exact URL)
* Keep `credentials: true`
* Confirm with DevTools whether cookies are sent and stored
