# Lexitra TM Management Guidelines

This document defines the recommended approach to storing and managing Translation Memory (TM) entries within the Lexitra platform.

---

## ‚úÖ TM Entry Status vs Origin

In Lexitra, a TM entry has two distinct attributes:

- **Status**: Indicates the review state of a segment.
  - `Draft`: Unreviewed translation, either AI-generated or human input
  - `Reviewed`: Confirmed by human reviewer
  - `Rejected`: Explicitly marked as incorrect; excluded from TM matching

- **Origin**: Indicates how the translation was originally generated.
  - `MT`: Machine Translation (e.g., GPT)
  - `100%`: Exact match from TM
  - `Fuzzy`: Partial match from TM
  - `HT`: Human-translated or human-edited

> Only entries with `Reviewed` status are used for TM matching.  
> `Origin` helps explain how the translation was initially produced.

### Status Table

| Status     | Description                                              | Stored in TM  | Default Visibility |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `Draft`    | Unreviewed; may be machine-generated or manually written | ‚úÖ            | ‚ùå                  |
| `Reviewed` | Confirmed by reviewer; used for TM matching              | ‚úÖ            | ‚úÖ                  |
| `Rejected` | Marked as invalid; excluded from matching                | ‚úÖ            | ‚ùå                  |

> When a segment is reviewed and saved, the `origin` is updated to `HT` if modified by a human.

## ‚úÖ TM Save Conditions

| Condition             | Save to TM? | Status     |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Reviewed by human     | ‚úÖ Yes      | `Reviewed` (origin set to `HT` if edited; otherwise retains original) |

* Only `Reviewed` entries are stored in the TM. Unreviewed (Draft) or Rejected segments are excluded.

---

## ‚úÖ Editor to TM Workflow

This section clarifies how a segment‚Äôs `status` and `origin` evolve during translation and how that affects TM storage and retrieval.

### Editor View (During Translation)

| Action in Editor                            | Status in Editor | Origin in Editor |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| GPT translation inserted                    | `Draft`          | `MT`             |
| 100% TM match inserted                      | `Draft`          | `100%`           |
| Fuzzy TM match inserted                     | `Draft`          | `Fuzzy`          |
| Human manually writes translation           | `Draft`          | `HT`             |
| Human edits GPT/TM match                    | `Draft`          | `HT`             |
| Human confirms translation (clicks Review)  | `Reviewed`       | See below        |

- When a segment is **marked as Reviewed**:
  - If the segment was **edited by a human**, `origin` is updated to `HT`.
  - If not edited, original `origin` (e.g., `MT`, `100%`, `Fuzzy`) is retained.

### TM Storage (After Review)

- Only `Reviewed` segments are stored in TM.
- In TM:
  - `origin` reflects how the translation originated (or `HT` if edited).
  - `status` is always `Reviewed`.

This ensures TM only contains verified, high-quality translations while preserving origin context.

## ‚úÖ TM Deduplication Logic

To prevent multiple identical TM entries from being stored:

### üîç Deduplication Key:

* `source` + `target`

### üõ† Behavior:

* On save, check if same `source` + `target` exists:

  * ‚úÖ If exists with same status ‚Üí **skip**
  * ‚úÖ If exists with different status ‚Üí **update status**
  * ‚ùå If not exists ‚Üí **insert new entry**

---

## ‚úÖ Handling of TM "Use" Action

When user clicks "Use" on a TM suggestion:

* System should **check if entry already exists** (same source/target)

  * If it exists ‚Üí **do not add duplicate**
  * Optionally update `status` to `Reviewed`

---

## ‚úÖ Fuzzy Match Handling

Fuzzy matches refer to TM suggestions that are **partially matched** to the source segment:

| Scenario                      | TM Status Change                  | Notes                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fuzzy match auto-suggested    | No immediate TM change            | Used for suggestion only    |
| Human accepts/edits & reviews | Update or create `Reviewed` entry | Saved as new reviewed match |

* Fuzzy matches **do not automatically enter TM**.
* If a fuzzy match is edited and marked as reviewed, a `Reviewed` entry is stored in the TM. The origin remains `Fuzzy` unless the system or user updates it. No unreviewed fuzzy entries are stored.

---

## ‚úÖ Rejected Status Handling

If a TM entry is marked as `Rejected`, it is not used for matching or suggestions. However, to support flexible review workflows, the system should allow manual restoration:

- Provide a **"Restore"** action on `Rejected` entries.
- Allow user to select which status to restore to:
  - `Draft` (if further revision is needed)
  - `Reviewed` (if rejection was a mistake)

This allows reviewers to recover or reclassify rejected translations efficiently.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Use `MT`, `Draft`, `Reviewed` as standard TM statuses.
* Only `Reviewed` is shown and used by default.
* Avoid duplicates by checking source/target combinations.
* Fuzzy suggestions are never stored in TM unless reviewed.
* Consider upserting TM entries based on status updates.
* When reviewed, segments edited by a human are marked with origin `HT`. If not edited, original origin is retained.

These TM practices help maintain quality, reduce noise, and ensure consistent reuse of trusted translations within Lexitra.
