# Lexitra Navigation Structure & UI Title Simplification

This document outlines proposed improvements to Lexitra's page navigation and menu title structure for better usability and clarity.

---

## ✅ Problems Identified

### 1. Header Click Misrouting

* Clicking the top header title (e.g., "Termbase") redirects to the Dashboard, not the logical parent section.
* This occurs even when the user is deep within a subpage (e.g., inside a specific Project).

### 2. Redundant Title Usage

* The same title is repeated in:

  * Sidebar (e.g., "Projects")
  * Header (e.g., "Projects")
  * Page content title (e.g., "Projects")

### 3. Lack of Visual Hierarchy

* No breadcrumb or parent-child page relationship visible
* Users can’t tell which glossary or project they are viewing from the top layout alone

---

## ✅ Proposed Solutions

### 1. Header: Implement Breadcrumb Navigation (Replace Tabs with Routes)

To improve clarity and navigability across Lexitra pages, we propose replacing header titles and internal tabs with a breadcrumb-based navigation structure paired with distinct page routes.

#### Why Breadcrumbs?
* Show user's current location in a hierarchical path (e.g., `Termbase > Termbase Entries`)
* Help users easily move back to parent pages
* Reflect true navigation context — prevents confusion with top-level headers like “Termbase”

#### Why Remove Tabs in Body Content?
Currently, Termbase and Admin Tools use tab-style components in the content area (e.g., “Glossary Entries” / “TB Resources”). However, this pattern:
* Obscures navigation context (URL doesn't reflect the current view)
* Limits browser features (no back button, no bookmarkable views)
* Makes it hard to scale when tab content grows or diverges in complexity

#### Recommended Change:
* Use breadcrumb-based header:
  - Example: `Termbase > Termbase Entries`
  - All segments are clickable
* Each sub-view (like "Glossary Entries", "TB Resources", etc.) becomes a **separate route**
  - e.g., `/termbase/entries`, `/termbase/resources`
  - Each route has its own page layout and URL
* Remove tab UI in page body to reduce confusion

#### Benefits:
* Consistent URL-based navigation
* Easily shareable links and better browser compatibility
* Clearer mental model for users
* Easier to manage routing logic in frontend frameworks like Next.js

### 2. Page Title Redundancy Cleanup

* Remove or minimize repeated page titles in the main content area
* Use contextual subheaders instead:

  * e.g., "Glossary Entries" under breadcrumb

## ✅ Resulting Benefits

* Improves clarity of user’s current location
* Prevents accidental Dashboard redirection
* Removes visual clutter from duplicate labels
* Aligns with common UX patterns in translation/localization tools

These changes aim to create a more intuitive, scalable navigation structure for Lexitra’s users across different workflows.

## ✅ Glossary vs Termbase Usage

Many users are confused between "glossary" and "termbase." While these terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings in the context of localization tools:

| Term         | Description                                          | Typical Usage                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Glossary** | A list of key terms and their approved translations | Simple format, often shown in UI       |
| **Termbase** | A structured terminology database                   | Includes metadata, used in backend     |

**Glossary** is typically a UI-facing concept — a simple bilingual term list.
**Termbase** (TB), on the other hand, refers to the backend structure that supports rich metadata (e.g., domain, language pair, status, definitions, notes).

### Lexitra Usage

- **Termbase** is the container (e.g., `Default TB`)
- **Glossary Entries** are individual terms (source ↔ target) managed within each termbase

Thus, it's valid to use both terms:
- Use **"Glossary"** in UI for familiarity
- Use **"Termbase"** in structural or admin settings

This dual usage is intentional and mirrors industry standards found in CAT tools like SDL Trados or memoQ.

## ✅ Termbase Navigation & Page Simplification

### Context
Previously, Lexitra used the term **"TB Resource"** for the page that lists all termbases and allows creation or deletion of them.

However, the term **"Resource"** is too generic and unclear for users, especially in a translation/localization context.

### Decision
We will stop using the word "Resource" and adopt clearer, task-oriented names.

### Updated Navigation & Naming

- The page showing the **list of termbases** should be called **"Termbases"**.
- That page should:
  - Show all termbases available to the user
  - Allow users (admin only, if needed) to create or delete termbases
- Each termbase item in the list links to its entries:
  - Path: `/termbase/[tbId]/entries`
  - Page title: "Glossary Entries"

### Optional Future Refinement
If the list of termbases grows large in the future or requires metadata filtering, we may split the view:
- `/termbase` for overview
- `/termbase/[tbId]/entries` for entries

For now, keep them within the same section and simplify the UI.
