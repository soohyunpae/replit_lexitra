# Lexitra – Header & Sidebar Layout Improvements

This document proposes improvements to the Lexitra layout, focusing on visual clarity and consistency across the header and sidebar. These changes aim to reduce redundancy, improve responsiveness, and streamline navigation.

---

## 🧭 Sidebar Improvements

### ✅ Collapsible Sidebar

* Allow sidebar to collapse to icons only (like Phrase).
* When collapsed, page titles (e.g. "Projects") should appear in the header to indicate current section.

### ✅ Remove Redundant Divider

* Remove the horizontal divider under the Lexitra logo in the sidebar.
* This avoids visual misalignment with the top header when sidebar is expanded.

### ✅ Menu Cleanup

* Keep essential items only:

  * Dashboard
  * Projects
  * Terminology Base
  * Translation Memory
  * Admin Tools (if admin)
* ❌ Remove "File Preprocessing" and redundant "Translation Memory" entries under Admin Tools (already integrated into TM Management).

### ✅ Settings & Logout Placement

* Keep ⚙️ Settings and 🚪 Logout in the **top-right corner of the app**, not in the sidebar.

## 🧱 Header Bar Enhancements

### ✅ Unify Navigation Labeling

* Remove duplicate labels that appear both in the header and in the main content area.
* For example: The label "Projects" appears in both the header and directly below it in the page content. ✅ Keep it in the **header only**, and remove from main content.

### ✅ Adjust Header Height & Padding

* Ensure the top header and sidebar heights align visually.
* Reduce padding/margin inconsistencies.

### ✅ Responsive Behavior

* On small screens or when sidebar is collapsed:

  * Show current section (e.g., “Projects”) in the header
  * Keep user controls (Settings/Logout) accessible via dropdown

## 🧠 Design Rationale

* Avoids visual redundancy
* Keeps layout clean and focused
* Follows modern app UI patterns (like Phrase, Figma, etc.)
* Makes the experience more intuitive across screen sizes

Once implemented, these changes will result in a more consistent, professional, and user-friendly interface for Lexitra users.
