## âœ… Project Status Labels (New)

| Status Label | Meaning                            | Who Sees It?          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Not Started  | Project is unclaimed and available | Everyone              |
| In Progress  | Project is claimed by current user | Claiming user only    |
| Taken        | Project is claimed by someone else | All other users       |
| Completed    | Project is finished                | Only in completed tab |

* Filter dropdown should use these labels:

  * All / Not Started / In Progress / Taken / Completed

## ðŸ§© Project List Page Changes

### 1. **Status Filter Dropdown**

* Add a filter component to filter projects by status (above grid/list)

### 2. **Grid View Improvements**

* Ensure status badges do **not overlap with text** on smaller screens
* Position badges consistently (e.g. top-right corner of card)

### 3. **List View Improvements**

* Remove unnecessary icons from `Created`, `Last Updated`, `Deadline` columns
* Remove **Actions column**:

  * Project name becomes the clickable link to open details
  * Actions like Claim / Reopen / Delete moved to project detail page

### 4. **Project Description Preview**

* In list view, show one-line summary of project description for quick context

### 5. **Responsive Layout**

* Ensure buttons, badges, and columns do not break layout at small screen sizes

## ðŸ”„ Project Interaction Actions (Where They Appear)

| Action   | Appears in...           | Who Can Use It   | Location                          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Claim    | Grid/List (Not Started) | All users        | Inside card or inline with status |
| Release  | Detail Page             | Claimer only     | Button in project header/section  |
| Complete | Detail Page             | Claimer only     | Button                            |
| Reopen   | Completed Detail Page   | Claimer or Admin | Button in header                  |
| Delete   | Completed Detail Page   | Admin only       | Dropdown or button                |

This approach reduces clutter on the project list while maintaining clarity and control through the project detail view. The goal is to simplify navigation, improve responsiveness, and make workflows intuitive across roles and screen sizes.
