Lexitra – Project Page UI Improvements Summary

This document outlines the UI/UX improvements proposed for the Lexitra project list and detail pages, covering both grid and list views, and status logic.

⸻

✅ Project Status Labels (New)

Status Label	Meaning	Who Sees It?
Not Started	Project is unclaimed and available	Everyone
In Progress	Project is claimed by current user	Claiming user only
Taken	Project is claimed by someone else	All other users
Completed	Project is finished	Only in completed tab

	•	Filter dropdown should use these labels:
	•	All / Not Started / In Progress / Taken / Completed

⸻

🧩 Project List Page Changes

1. Status Filter Dropdown
	•	Add a filter component to filter projects by status (above grid/list)

2. Grid View Improvements
	•	Ensure status badges do not overlap with text on smaller screens
	•	Position badges consistently (e.g. top-right corner of card)

3. List View Improvements
	•	Remove unnecessary icons from Created, Last Updated, Deadline columns
	•	Remove Actions column:
	•	Project name becomes the clickable link to open details
	•	Actions like Claim / Reopen / Delete moved to project detail page

4. Project Description Preview
	•	In list view, show one-line summary of project description for quick context

5. Responsive Layout
	•	Ensure buttons, badges, and columns do not break layout at small screen sizes

🔄 Project Interaction Actions (Where They Appear)

Action	Appears in…	Who Can Use It	Location
Claim	Grid/List (Not Started)	All users	Inside card or inline with status
Release	Detail Page	Claimer only	Button in project header/section
Complete	Detail Page	Claimer only	Button
Reopen	Completed Detail Page	Claimer or Admin	Button in header
Delete	Completed Detail Page	Admin only	Dropdown or button

This approach reduces clutter on the project list while maintaining clarity and control through the project detail view. The goal is to simplify navigation, improve responsiveness, and make workflows intuitive across roles and screen sizes.
