## ‚úÖ Project Status Lifecycle

Projects can exist in one of five clearly labeled states:

| Status Label | Meaning                            | Who Sees It?          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Unclaimed    | Project is unclaimed and available | Everyone              |
| In Progress  | Project is claimed by current user | Claiming user only    |
| Claimed      | Project is claimed by someone else | All other users       |
| Completed    | Project is marked finished         | Everyone (via filter) |

### Status Filtering Dropdown
- Filter options: `All`, `Unclaimed`, `In Progress`, `Claimed`, `Completed`
- Location: top-right of the `/projects` page

## üß© Project List Page UI Improvements

### 1. Grid View
- Ensure status badges (e.g., Completed, In Progress) do not overlap text
- Badge placement: Top-right of card
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

### 2. List View
- Remove icons from `Created`, `Last Updated`, and `Deadline` columns
- Remove `Actions` column:
  - Clicking **Project Name** opens the project detail view
  - Project description preview shown below the name
- Ensure layout is compact and clean across resolutions

### 3. Responsive Layout
- Badges, text, and buttons must scale properly on all screen sizes

## üîÑ Project Interaction Actions

All project-related actions (Claim, Release, Complete, Reopen, Delete) should be available within the **project detail page**‚Äîthe page that opens when a user clicks a project name from the project list. This helps keep the project list clean and prevents accidental actions.

- **Claim**: Visible only when the project is in ‚ÄúUnclaimed‚Äù status and unclaimed. Any user can claim the project.
- **Release**: Available only to the user who claimed the project, if the project is in progress.
- **Complete**: Available only to the claiming user, shown when the project is ready to be marked finished.
- **Reopen**: Visible only for completed projects, accessible to the previous claimer or an admin.
- **Delete**: Visible only to admins, and only when the project is completed. Can be a standalone button or placed in a dropdown.

These buttons should not be placed next to "Add File", as their purpose is related to project workflow rather than file upload. Replit may choose the appropriate UI placement.
